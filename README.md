# Me
Hello I'm @ItsLogic.

I go by Draff or Logic or comamnds

You can contact me on discord @draff

I also have a youtube channel I never post on: [comamnds](https://www.youtube.com/@comamnds)

# About Me
- I am terminally online and mentally ill.
- My main language is C# but I also know: Python, a small amount of C++, a small amount of ASM and a small amount of java/kotlin.
- My hobbies are: AI, Archival, Beta/Alpha/Debug software and games, playing with cutting edge tech, Selfhosting, and reverse engineering.
- I would like to know much more C++ and learn rust but I'm extremely lazy.

# My Projects
### [Xbox Achievement Unlocker](https://github.com/ItsLogic/Xbox-Achievement-Unlocker)

This is my main project which I work on solo although I am accepting pull requests :)

### [Forza Mods AIO](https://github.com/ForzaMods/AIO)

I prevously worked on the now obsolite V1 of this tool and various private tools relating to the forza series. I no longer work on these tools but still manage the repositories, [Forza Mods Github organisation](https://github.com/ForzaMods) and the Forza Mods discord server.

# Future Projects
Yeah man idk, right now I'm just trying to get a job. I code as a hobby so if something I find interesting comes up I'll probably work on it.
